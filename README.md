Here is my submission for the Vault Take Home Test: Browse Grid.

####If I had more time I would:

+ Improve on the easy loading feature on scroll down so that it works on loading smaller sets of images.

+ Add two top navbars like in the demo, with select all feature, asset count number, authentication feature, etc.

+ Add more asset sorting options by tags, features and size.

+ Figure out how to make jquery interact with mustache.js templates.

+ Fix any bugs that I might have missed.
